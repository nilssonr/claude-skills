# Frontend Aesthetics

You tend to converge toward generic, "on distribution" outputs. In frontend design,
this creates what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative,
distinctive frontends that surprise and delight. Focus on:

Typography: Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt for distinctive choices.
Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Dominant colors with sharp accents
outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
Motion: Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered
reveals creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.
Backgrounds: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors.

Avoid: Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial), purple gradients on white,
predictable layouts, cookie-cutter design. Interpret creatively and make unexpected
choices. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics.
